    <h2>Atharva Khandelwal</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a first-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, hailing from the vibrant city of New York. Alongside my major, I've embarked on a minor in Economics.

My enthusiasm lies in exploring the crossroads of technology and various interdisciplinary fields. I'm eager to channel this passion into meaningful contributions, particularly through involvement with Bits of Good, especially in terms of bettering the enviornment around us. For more about me, feel free to visit my LinkedIn linked below. I'm also excited to learn about you â€“ drop your name in the space provided, and I'll extend a warm welcome!</p>
